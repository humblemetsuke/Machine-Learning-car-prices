# Machine-Learning-car-prices
Machine 


This project is a calculation utilising 4 different machine learning algorithms to ascertain which variables affect car prices.

Random Forest, Logistic regression, polynomial regression and linear regression were all employed to determine the final result.

A comparison of each of the performance metrics of each algorithm is recorded, along with a correlation matrix and heatmap to identify the most significant variables.
