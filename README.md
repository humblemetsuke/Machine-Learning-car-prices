# Machine-Learning-car-prices
Machine 


This project is a calculation utilising 4 different machine learning algorithms to ascertain which variables affect car prices.

Random Forest, Logistic regression, polynomial regression and linear regression were all employed to determine the final result.

A comparison of each of the performance metrics of each algorithm is recorded, along with a correlation matrix and heatmap to identify the most significant variables.

The csv file contained the raw data that was utilised as the dataset and exists in its raw form.
The final report pdf file contains the data modelling.
